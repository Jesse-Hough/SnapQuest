# Project 4 - *SnapQuest*

Submitted by: **Jesse Hough**

**SnapQuest** is an app that orchestrates photo-based scavenger hunts, prompting users to fulfill tasks by uploading relevant images, then leveraging metadata to pinpoint and display the photo's origin on a map, marking each task as completed upon photo submission.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays list of hard-coded tasks
- [X] When a task is tapped it navigates the user to a task detail view
- [X] When user adds photo to complete the tasks, it marks the task as complete
- [X] When adding photo of task, the location is added
- [X] User returns to home page (list of tasks) and the status of your task is updated to complete
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can launch camera to snap a picture	

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- To improve this application, I could add the feature to allow users to take a picture with their phone instead of selecting a pre-existing one.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- One challenge I faced during the creation of this app was getting the photo to populate on the map instead of the pin.
- Another challenge was having the program prompt the user to request access to their photo library.
